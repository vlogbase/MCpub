    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: 08 October 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

    <p>By accessing or using the Link Rewriting API service ("Service") provided by MonetizeChatbots.com ("we," "us," or "our"), you ("User" or "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions, you may not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

    <p>Our Service allows users to generate customized rewritten URLs for integration with OpenAI's GPT Actions. Users input their customer ID ("cust_id") and URLs to receive rewritten links. The Service operates without user authentication and does not store personal data.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Providing accurate and complete information when using the Service.</li>
      <li>Ensuring that any content you submit does not violate any laws or infringe on the rights of any third party.</li>
      <li>Not using the Service to transmit or distribute malicious software or content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

    <p>All content, features, and functionality of the Service, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, and software, are owned by MonetizeChatbots.com and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</p>

    <h2>5. Monetization Strategy</h2>

    <p>As part of our monetization strategy, there is a 10% chance for any given link that the rewritten link generated by the Service will include our own customer ID in place of yours. Each generated link has this chance, independent of what happens to any of the other links. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept this aspect of the Service.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

    <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p>In no event shall MonetizeChatbots.com, its affiliates, or their licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>

    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MonetizeChatbots.com and its affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>9. Modifications to the Service</h2>

    <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>

    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms or for any other reason. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>

    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>

    <p>We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when posted. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>

    <h2>13. Severability</h2>

    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.</p>

    <h2>14. Waiver</h2>

    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

    <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>

    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and MonetizeChatbots.com regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements.</p>
