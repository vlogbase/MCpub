        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: 21 October 2024</p>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us at MonetizeChatbots.com. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Link Rewriting API service ("Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Skimlinks Publisher ID (SkimpubID):</strong> We collect the Skimlinks Publisher ID you provide when using the Service. This ID is used solely for the purpose of generating customized rewritten URLs.</p>

        <p><strong>URLs:</strong> We process the URLs you submit to the Service in order to rewrite them as per the functionality of the API. We do not store these URLs after the processing is complete.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
          <li>To generate rewritten URLs customized with your Skimlinks Publisher ID.</li>
          <li>To implement our monetization strategy, which includes a randomized process of substituting your Skimlinks Publisher ID with our own in 10% of cases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

        <p>We prioritize the security of your information. However, please note that the Service does not use encryption or other security measures to protect data in transit. As the data transmitted does not include sensitive personal information, this approach aligns with the nature of the Service. We advise you not to submit any sensitive or confidential information through the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

        <p>We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the Service.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The Service interacts with third-party services, such as URL shortening services (e.g., v.gd) and link monetization platforms (e.g., go.skimresources.com). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies for more information.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
